	<h1 class="title">What is this software ?</h1>

	<p>This software is a bridge between your electronic drum kit and the Rock Band Madcatz Midi Pro Adapter.</p>

	<p>It reads midi notes sent by your drum kit, transform those notes (if needed), and then sends new data to the Madcatz Midi Pro Adapter.</p>
	<p>But why to transform midi notes ? The main purpose is to translate some real drum techniques (eg: flams, hi-hat close/half-open/open, ghost notes etc...) and produce valid Rock Band midi notes to avoid a choke...</p>

	<p>A basic example are flams : in Rock Band, snare flams are charted in [red+yellow] pads (for a righty drummer), but if you want to do a real flam on your electronic snare you'll produce 2 red notes.</p>

	<p>eProDrums can interpret those hits and transform them to a [red+yellow] notes. Obviously, it can do more things...</p>

	<h1 class="title">Who should use this software ?</h1>

	<p>You should use this software if :
	<ul>
		<li>You play with the sound of your electronic drum kit and thus you have to play as real as possible (flams, open hi-hat etc...)</li>
		<li>You don't play with the drum kit sound but you want to keep your playing as real as possible (flams, open hi-hat etc...)</li>
		<li>You just want to use the hi-hat feature (close/half/open)</li>
		<li>You have a Roland VH-11 or VH-12 and want to use them with Rock Band (close/half/open)</li>
		<li>You want to add ghost notes in the chart</li>
		<li>You are just curious...</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h1 class="title">What do I need ?</h1>

	<p> You need : </p>
	<ol>
		<li>A computer under :</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Windows</li>
			<li>Linux</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Debian</li>
				<li>Ubuntu</li>
				<li>Raspbian</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>A midi to usb adapter. If you want to use the software on Linux be sure to buy a compatible cable</li>
		<li>The Madcatz Midi Pro Adapter</li>
		<li>Sticks...</li>
	</ol>

	<p>As you can see above, eProDrums works on a Raspberry Pi (Raspbian). A Raspberry Pi cost 30$ so don't buy an expensive computer just for eProDrums.</p>

	<p>There is no mention of Mac OX X. It's just because I can't test it (no hardware).</p>
